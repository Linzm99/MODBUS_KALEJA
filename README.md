# Modbus Library for KALEJA Devices

This Library brings support for KALEJA MODBUS Motor Controllers to the Arduino Environment. It lets you use all functionalities that you could have used with plain MODBUS commands, but you only have to call the functions and library does the rest.

All you need is a Hardware serial port on your controller to drive the RS485 Chip.

There are no additional libraries required that are not allready included into the Arduino IDE.

# How to install

To install this library follow these steps:

- (If you already have the Arduino IDE install skip this step) Install the current upstream Arduino IDE at the 1.8 level or later. The current version is on the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
- Download the latest version of this library by clicking on the green "Code" button and "Download ZIP" or by using this [link](https://github.com/Linzm99/MODBUS_KALEJA/archive/main.zip).
- Open your Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch>Include Library>Add .ZIP Library. Navigate to the MODBUS_KALEJA-main.zip file's location and select it.
- The Library should now be included.

## How to setup a Serial Connection

This is a short example on how to use the library. To see the actual function descriptions click [here]
To use this library you first have to include the library into your Arduino project.

```c
#include "MODBUS_KALEJA.h"
```

Next you have to setup a Serial Connection. This is done by creating an object of the class [MODBUS_KALEJA](# {Class} MODBUS_KALEJA) and feeding it the necessary parameters.
To start the Serial Connection you also have to call the begin() function of your MODBUS_KALEJA object.

```c
MODBUS_KALEJA bus1(Serial,1,1,2); //Setup an object of class MODBUS_KALEJA on the Serial Port, 38400 Baud, Parity = None, R/W pin on pin D2
//OR
MODBUS_KALEJA bus1(Serial,B_38000,P_NONE,2); //Same as above, but with using the defines as inputs
bus1.begin(); //Start the Serial Connection
```

Your Bus is now running and ready to talk to Motor Controllers.

## How to setup a Motor Controller Object

After selecting the device address with the DIP-Switch and Baudrate/Parity with the other switches you are now ready to setup a Motor Controller Object

```c
MControl motorController1(1,bus1); //Setup the Motor COntroller Object with Adress 0x01 on the preiviously created MODBUS_KALEJA Object
```

Now you are ready to use the Motor Controller functions.
Example:

```c
motorController1.MOTOR_ON(); //Start Motor
motorController1.PWM_ON(500); //Set Motor Speed to 50%
int32_t current = motorController1.CURRENT(); //Read the current the Motor is drawing richt now
motorController1.MOTOR_OFF(); //Stop Motor
```
